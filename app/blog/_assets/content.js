          <h3 className={styles.h3}>1. Use a Checklist</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            We've learned that the key to packing efficiently is a checklist. Essential items include diapers, wipes, a change of clothes, bottles, and snacks. For longer trips, add in toys, a travel blanket, and even a few plastic bags for messy situations. And don‚Äôt forget the <strong>baby bottle travel bag</strong> with insulated pockets ‚Äì it's a lifesaver for keeping bottles at the right temperature.

          <p className={styles.p}>
            If you‚Äôre traveling by plane, pack a <strong>baby travel bag for the plane</strong> with all the essentials within easy reach. Keep diapers, wipes, and bottles in outer pockets. Trust us, mid-flight diaper changes are much easier when you don‚Äôt have to dig around for supplies.

          <h3 className={styles.h3}>3. Choose the Right Bag for Your Needs</h3>
          <p className={styles.p}>
            Not every travel baby bag is created equal. For short trips, a compact bag with a few key compartments is perfect. For longer journeys, consider a bag like the <strong>Orbit Baby Travel Bag</strong> that offers plenty of space and easy access. Our top tip: always choose a bag that comes with a changing mat. You‚Äôll thank us later!
